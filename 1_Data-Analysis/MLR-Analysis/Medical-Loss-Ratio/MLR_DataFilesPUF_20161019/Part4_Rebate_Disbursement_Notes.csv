143144,"Amounts in Line 4.g represent the sum of unclaimed rebates for all prior reporting years. [CRLF][CRLF]In preparation for the 2014 MLR rebate mailing, John Alden Life Insurance Company (JALIC) address files were compared with USPS information. Updates to our system were made as necessary. [CRLF][CRLF]JALIC mailed the MLR rebate checks to the most current address as provided by our customers.  MLR checks for individual medical customers were mailed to their home addresses and checks for group medical customers were mailed to the employers’ addresses.  Checks for employers designated as Church Groups were mailed to the employees at their home addresses, if indicated on the attestation from the employer, or if no response to the attestation was received.[CRLF][CRLF]Following the rebate check mailing, the following steps were taken by JALIC to locate policyholders/subscribers when rebate checks returned by the post office as “undeliverable”:[CRLF][CRLF]1. Verify the address listed in our system matches the returned mail label.[CRLF]2. Determine if the return mail label contains any new or additional address information. [CRLF]3. Verify whether there were any requested updates or changes to the address that had not been processed yet.[CRLF]4. Review other documents received from the applicable policyholder/subscriber, such as recent checks, applications, faxes or correspondence that may identify a new address.[CRLF]5. Review any claims received under the policy to determine if an updated address was provided on such claim information.[CRLF]6. Research using on-line “Smart Pages People Search” for name, telephone number and address[CRLF]7. Call the customer to verify address (for our individual medical customers only)[CRLF]8. Call the group administrator to verify address for the group (for our group customers only)[CRLF]9. Call the agent to verify the customer’s current address[CRLF]10. Email (if an email address was available) the customer or group administrator to verify the address[CRLF][CRLF]Pursuant to the process above, when updated address information became available, JALIC updated its systems and either re-mailed (to the correct address) or re-issued (if a check was lost or not received within a reasonable time frame) the MLR rebates to customers.[CRLF][CRLF]Approximately 3 months after the initial rebate check mailings, JALIC contacted via telephone those customers who appeared to have otherwise received their checks and requested that such customers cash the checks (or otherwise left voicemail requests to that effect).[CRLF][CRLF]Prior to making these telephone calls, we again reviews our records (as outlined with returned mail) to ensure there wasn’t any new information that would indicate we should simply re-mail the check to a corrected address. Therefore, the following process to place: [CRLF][CRLF]1. Automated calls were placed to individual medical customers to verify whether or not the rebate checks were received.[CRLF]2. Manual calls were placed and emails were sent (where email addresses existed) to group administrator to verify if rebate check were received.[CRLF]3. If customers (individual or group) confirmed receipt of their rebate checks, we advised them to cash it.[CRLF]4. If a customer indicated that an address correction was required and/or the check had not been received, placed a stop payment on the original uncashed check and re-issued a new check (to the corrected address, if applicable).[CRLF][CRLF]Following the foregoing attempts, if checks remain uncashed, they will ultimately be escheated in accordance with applicable state laws.  We will re-send or re-issue, as applicable, MLR rebate checks to the extent a request is made for such rebate amounts by the appropriate payee prior to the applicable escheatment timeframe.[CRLF][CRLF]For group medical customers whose health policies have terminated with JALIC, on or after the rebates were distributed, we disbursed the unclaimed rebate amounts in equal shares to the individual subscribers/group members as described in our response to Line 4.h below.[CRLF][CRLF]Each of the steps described in this response to Line 4.h were documented in our systems.","As described above in response to Line 4.h, JALIC took a number of steps to locate correct mailing addresses for its customers and to contact those customers who had not otherwise cashed their MLR rebate checks.  Prior to any MLR check mailing, JALIC compared internal customer addresses with USPS information. Updated were made as necessary.[CRLF][CRLF]Approximately three (3) months after the rebate checks were mailed, JALIC attempted to contact our customers who had not yet cashed their rebate checks (regardless of whether they were retuned as “undeliverable”).  For Individual Medical customers, an automated call program was used to contact these customers with an option to talk to a live customer service representative if desired.
